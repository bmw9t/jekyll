##Module Goals
In this lesson you will learn how to use *[Audacity](http://audacityteam.org/)* to edit and mix audio files. Sound editing platforms are often expensive and offer extensive capabilities that can be overwhelming to the first-time user, but *Audacity* is a free and open source alternative that offers powerful capabilities for sound editing with a low barrier for entry. In this lesson you will learn how to load, record, mix, and export audio files using the tool. For this lesson we will work with two audio files: a recording of SOMETHING MUSICAL available [here]() and another recording of your own voice that will be made in the course of the lesson. By the end of it you will have mixed these two files together into something resembling the beginning of a podcast.

##Installing Audacity

*Audacity* is available download on [the project site](http://audacityteam.org/). Download the program and doubleclick to install.

To get started, we will start with a recording

##The Audacity interface - 

When you open audio in Audacity 

*Audacity* allows you to record new sounds. To give us something to work with, give it a try by pressing the big red circle at the top left of the *Audacity* window. Hit the square to stop recording when you are done. You will be presented with something that looks like this:

*Audacity* converts your sound into a a waveform, a commonly used mode for representing sound. The x-axis represents time: the beginning of the sound occurs at the far left of the interface, and *Audacity* ticks off periodic time markers as the wave continues to the right. If we click the play button, *Audacity* will move from left to right over the sound, with a vertical line representing our currrent point in the clip. The y-axis represents amplitude, what we experience as loudness. Silence begins as a flat line, and the sound will get taller and deeper as it increases in intensity. 

*Audacity*'s representation of time and amplitude are your first and easiest point of reference for editing sound, and the tool offers handy ways to navigate around them. I keep calling this a wave, but it doesn't look all that much like one just yet. Let's take a closer look by selecting "Zoom in" on the View menu or hitting command 1 on a mac or control 1 on a PC. If you zoom in four or five times, you'll start to see something that might be more like a sine or cosine wave. Take note of how the time increments in *Audacity* have also adjusted as you zoom in. Pitch frequencies are measured in waves per second; the program has to smash things together a bit to make the whole sound clip fit in a workable window, and the result is the waveform that we see when we zoom back out. But each view - the micro and the macro - has its own uses. We will come back to both.

##Working with Audio

Unless you recorded in a vaccuum, you probably noticed a popping sound at the beginning and ending of your recording. 

By clicking and draging over the waveform we can highlight 


So far we have uploaded a sound, but

By default, *Audacity* will not overwrite your previous recording. Instead, it isolates both soundstreams, or tracks, for you to work with separately.  


a bit on recording using your own laptop and working with proprietary sounds that require you to rerecord them
